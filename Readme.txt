AntTweakBar development library
-------------------------------

(Original README)
AntTweakBar is a small and easy-to-use C/C++ library that allows programmers
to quickly add a light and intuitive GUI into OpenGL and DirectX based 
graphic programs to interactively tweak parameters.

This package includes the development version of the AntTweakBar library 
for Windows, GNU/Linux and OSX, and some program examples (sources + binaries).

For installation and documentation please refer to:

Addition by sasmaster (https://github.com/sasmaster/AntTweakBarGLFW3):

Because on my projects I upgraded to GLFW3 I also needed to modify the source 
of the AntTweakBar as it  supported only GLFW 2.X
I am not sure I implemented all the callback methods from GLFW3.You can
check in AntTweakBar.h what is implemented currently.

- I compiled the new repo in VS2015, and update the new binary files.
